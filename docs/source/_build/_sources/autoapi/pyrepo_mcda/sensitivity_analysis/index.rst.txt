.. py:class:: Sensitivity_analysis_weights

   .. py:method:: __call__(self, matrix, weights, types, percentages, method, j, dir_list)

      Method for sensitivity analysis. This method determines rankings of alternatives using chosen
      MCDA method name `mcda_name` for different modifications of criterion `j` weight.

      :param matrix: Decision matrix with alternatives performances data. This matrix includes
                     data on m alternatives in rows considering criteria in columns
      :type matrix: ndarray
      :param weights: Vector with criteria weights. All weights in this vector must sum to 1.
      :type weights: ndarray
      :param types: Vector with criteria types. Types can be equal to 1 for profit criteria and -1
                    for cost criteria.
      :type types: ndarray
      :param percentages: Vector with percentage values of given criteria weight modification.
      :type percentages: ndarray
      :param method: Initialized object of class of chosen MCDA method
      :type method: class
      :param j: Index of column in decision matrix `matrix` that indicates for which criterion
                the weight is modified.
      :type j: int
      :param dir_list: list with directions (signs of value) of criterion weight modification. 1 denotes increasing,
                       and -1 denotes decreasing weight value. You can provide [-1, 1] for increasing and
                       decreasing, [-1] for only decreasing, or [1] for only increasing chosen criterion weight.
      :type dir_list: list

      :returns: **data_sens** -- dataframe with rankings calculated for subsequent modifications of criterion j weight
      :rtype: DataFrame


   .. py:method:: _change_weights(self, j, weights, change_val)

      Method for criteria weights modification in sensitivity analysis procedure.

      :param j: Index of column in decision matrix `matrix` that indicates for which criterion
                the weight is modified.
      :type j: int
      :param weights: Vector of criteria weights
      :type weights: ndarray
      :param change_val: Percentage value of criterion weight modification
      :type change_val: float

      :returns: **weights_copy** -- Vector with criteria weights after modification their values for sensitivity analysis
      :rtype: ndarray


   .. py:method:: _sensitivity_analysis_weights(self, matrix, weights, types, percentages, method, list_alt_names, j, dir_list)
